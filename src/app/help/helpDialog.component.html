<h1 mat-dialog-title>How to Play:</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p class="mat-body-1">Each challenge is played in 5 rounds.
        Each round you will be given a random verse. You will then have to guess the reference for that verse.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1">You can score from 0-100 based on how close your guess is to the actual reference, 100 points being the best score. 
        The smaller the book of scripture the closer you have to be. 
        For example, the Book of Mormon has 6604 verses in it and you have to be within 660 verses to score points. 
        Also, if you are a nerd ðŸ¤“ and don't look at the chapter, you get double points.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1">There is a daily challenge for each book of scripture.
